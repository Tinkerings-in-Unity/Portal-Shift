# Portal Shift
This is an old game prototype I made. Where the aim is to collect all the stars by making the square touch them. 
You move the square via portals, toggle the bottom switch to make a red or green one. 
When the square passes through the portals it's speed increases so you can also use this to your advantage in some situations

## How to run
Start from the home scene if you are running directly in Unity

## Disclaimer
This was made at a time I didn't use version control so that's why there is a single big commit with all the game code :)
